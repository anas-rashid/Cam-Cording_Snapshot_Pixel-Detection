To just use all the applications you can look into the folder named "Data" it contains all the built exe files of all the three projects.

The "Data" folder also contains two video files one recorded from the application that has been made in part 1 of the assignment, named "video.avi" and also a sample video file for the movement detection of red pixel in it, named "part3-test.avi"

This part is important to record the video in part 1 and to read the video file in part 2 I have used a video decoder named "wmv9VCMsetup.exe", it is also present in Data folder and must be installed in order to record the video or to take a snapshot in a video.

I've used the .avi the format to write or read a video so all the video input must be in .avi format.

In case of building this project:-

After the recording of the video the video file is saved in bin\Debug folder of the project with the name of "video.avi".
Similarly,  the snapshot file in part 2 of the assignment is also stored in bin\Debug folder of the socond project with the name of "snapshot.jpg".
The part 3 of the project both displays and stores the co-ordinated of the pixel. It saves the co-ordinates in the file named "RedDotCoordinateInfo.txt"
